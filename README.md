This project demonstrates the HMVC pattern and how it applies to Codeigniter. Components (model, controller and view) are arranged in an application modules sub-directory. I have found HMVC pattern has several benefits over MVC pattern, especially:

- Reduction of dependencies between the disparate parts of the application.
- Organization, having a folder for each of the relevant triads makes for a lighter work load.
